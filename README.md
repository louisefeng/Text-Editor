# Text Editor

## Introduction
The simple text editor behaves similarly to text editors that allow you to edit un-styled text (e.g., pico, Notepad, and TextEdit) and has a variety of functionalities. Beyond simply supporting typing, users can use arrow keys and mouse clicks to navigate through the text, backspace, change the window size (and expect the text to wrap appropriately), adjust font size (`ctrl and +` or `ctrl and -`), scroll if necessary, and save the files they're working on (`ctrl and s`).

## Usage

The text editor requires 3 files to run: Editor.java, Copyfile.java, and LinkedListDeque.java, all of which are bundled in the editor package. Run the editor with the command `java editor.Editor {example.txt}` where {example.txt} is a text file that the text editor can both read from and write to. if {example.txt} does not exist, the text editor creates a file with the same name that the user may later save if they desire.
